# Orchestrate.js Example

This is an example of how to use the Orchestrate node.js client (available [here](https://github.com/Bowery/orchestrate.js)).

## Getting Started

This tutorial uses [Bowery](http://bowery.io) to run, making it super easy to get the right development environment up and running. You can download Bowery [here](http://docs.bowery.io/install).

Once you've installed Bowery...

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bowery/orchestrate.js-example.git
$ bowery connect
```
